Thermodynamic Snooker Project - An investigation into thermodynamics.
Author: Abdul-Wadoud Charbak


The following files represent a Simulation and the associated thermodynamic investigations after it.

There are 6 files:

Ball.py
Simulation.py
Task_10.py
Task_11+12.py
Task_13.py
Task_14.py

Ball.py contains the class Ball used in the Simulations. It can be imported into any program to be used.

Simulation.py contains the class Simulation and is the Simulation. It imports and uses the Class Ball.

The Task_number.py files indicate the thermodynamic investigations I did and which task it corresponded to from the Lab Script.

Task_10.py outputs Figures 1 to 4 of the investigation and focusses on inter-ball investigations and KE and Momentum conservation.

Task_11+12.py outputs figure 6 (5 if you edit the code) and investigates the link between Pressure and Temperature.

Task_13.py focusses on velocity distribution and outputs figure 7.

Task_14.py compares the Pressure to the number of balls in the Simulation and outputs Figure 8.

If any further elaboration is required, please don't hesitate to contact me.
